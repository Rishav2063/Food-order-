            The Online Food Ordering System's main purpose is to maintain track of information such as Item Category,
            Food, Delivery Address, Order, and Shopping Cart. It keeps track of information about the Item Category,
            the Customer, the Shopping Cart, and the Item Category. Only the administrator gets access to the project
            because it is totally built at the administrative level. The project's purpose is to develop software that will 
            cut down on the time spent manually managing Item Category, Food, Customer, and Delivery Address. It saves the Delivery
            Address, Order, and Shopping Cart information.
